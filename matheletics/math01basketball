In a basket ball match, a player scores a basket in his first attempt and misses in his second attempt. Now for every attempt, the probability of scoring a basket is equal to the success rate of the previous attempts i.e. the total number of baskets scored to the total number of attempts so far.

For example, the probability of scoring the third basket is 1/2 since the number of baskets scored is 1 and the total number of attempts are 2. Now, if he scores a basket in his third attempt, the probability of scoring a basket in his fourth attempt will be 2/3.

In the match, a player attempts a total of 2013 times to score a basket. What is the probability that he scores exactly 1000 times.

Answer will be in the form of P/Q where P and Q are integers and relatively co-prime.


def calc() = {
  def P(f: (Int,Int) => Rational)(S: Int, F: Int): Rational = {
    val A = S + F;
    val M = 1000 - S;
    if (A >= 2013) 1
    else if (M < 0) 0
    else if (2013 - A + 1 < M) 0
    else {
      val ps = Rational(S, A);
      ps * f(S+1,F) + (1-ps)*f(S,F+1)
    }
  }
  val Pm = memoize(P, (0, 1000), (0, 2000))
  for (S <- 0 to 1000; F <- 0 to 1013) Pm(1000-S, 1013-F)
  (Pm(0,1)+Pm(1,0)) / 2
}
